# Your first transaction

## Build

Let's create a simple transaction where we send `5 ADA` to two recipients each:

```typescript
const tx = await lucid.newTx()
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testa...", { lovelace: 5000000n })
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testb...", { lovelace: 5000000n })
  .complete();
```

NOTE the change from `payToAddress` to `pay.ToAddress` in Lucid Evolution.

Transactions always need to end with `.complete()` in order to balance the transaction and do coin selection.

## Sign
Next, we sign the transaction:

```typescript
const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();
```

NOTE the change from `sign()` to `sign.withWallet()` in Lucid Evolution.

Here we also need to call `.complete()` when we are ready with signing.

## Submit

Lastly we submit the transaction:

```typescript
const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
console.log(txHash);
```

Remember to select a wallet before attempting to build and submit transactions. The wallet selection methods we discussed in the previous section should be used before building the transaction.

## Putting everything together

```typescript
import { Lucid, Blockfrost } from "@lucid-evolution/lucid";

const lucid = await Lucid(
  new Blockfrost("https://cardano-preprod.blockfrost.io/api/v0", "<projectId>"),
  "Preprod"
);

// Assuming you've already selected a wallet using one of the methods we discussed earlier
// For example:
// lucid.selectWallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey);

const tx = await lucid.newTx()
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testa...", { lovelace: 5000000n })
  .pay.ToAddress("addr_testb...", { lovelace: 5000000n })
  .complete();

const signedTx = await tx.sign.withWallet().complete();

const txHash = await signedTx.submit();
console.log(txHash);
```
