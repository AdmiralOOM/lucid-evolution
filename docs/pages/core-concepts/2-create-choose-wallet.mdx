# Create a wallet

Lucid Evolution provides multiple options to create and import a wallet.

In this section, we'll cover a few methods, including using a private key and a new method introduced in Lucid Evolution.

## Using a Private Key

If you don't have a private key yet, you can generate one with Lucid Evolution:

```typescript
import { generatePrivateKey } from "@lucid-evolution/utils";

const privateKey = generatePrivateKey(); // Bech32 encoded private key
console.log(privateKey);
```

Now we can select a wallet using the private key with our Lucid Evolution instance:

```typescript
lucid.selectWallet.fromPrivateKey(privateKey);
```

Note the change in syntax from `selectWalletFromPrivateKey` -> `selectWallet.fromPrivateKey`

# Choosing Wallet

Use different methods to select a wallet and query balances, UTxOs.

## Using an Address and UTXOs Array

Lucid Evolution introduces a new method to select a wallet from an address and its UTXOs:

```typescript
const address = "addr_test..."; // Your wallet address
const utxos = await lucid.utxosAt(address);
lucid.selectWallet.fromAddress(address, utxos);
```
This method is useful when you have the address and UTXOs of a wallet but not necessarily the private key.

## Using a Seed Phrase

If you have a seed phrase (mnemonic), you can use it to select a wallet:

```typescript
const seedPhrase = "your seed phrase here...";
lucid.selectWallet.fromSeed(seedPhrase);
```

## Using a Wallet API

If you're integrating with a wallet provider that exposes an API conforming to the WalletApi interface, you can use it like this:

```typescript
import { WalletApi } from "@lucid-evolution/core-types";

// `externalWalletApi` is your wallet provider's API
const walletApi: WalletApi = externalWalletApi;
lucid.selectWallet.fromAPI(walletApi);
```

### Note

Selecting a wallet is necessary for building and submitting transactions. Make sure to select a wallet using one of these methods before attempting to create or submit transactions.
Remember that the exact method you use will depend on your use case and the type of wallet integration you're working with

## Query wallet

### Get address

```typescript
const address = await lucid.wallet.address(); // Bech32 address
```

### Query UTxOs

```typescript
const utxos = await lucid.wallet.getUtxos();
```

### Query delegation

```typescript
const delegation = await lucid.wallet.getDelegation();
```
