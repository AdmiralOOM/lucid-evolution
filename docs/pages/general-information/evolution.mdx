# Transition

-UNDER CONSTRUCTION-

Although the Evolution library shares the Lucid name, it is built with a different approach. You will need to install new packages.
While the endpoints remain mostly the same, the main difference you will encounter is that the Lucid instance is now a factory function instead of a class. We have worked hard to ensure the transition is as smooth as possible.
As a result there are only minor changes to the API, but the core concepts remain the same.

For example in legacy Lucid, you would typically do:

```typescript
const lucid = await Lucid.new(...)
```

In Lucid Evolution:

```typescript
const lucid = await Lucid(...)
```

This change affects how you initialize Lucid, but does not significantly change how you use its methods once initialized.

## Effect Library

Lucid Evolution uses the Effect library to handle complex operations in TypeScript. This helps manage errors better, makes async code easier to work with, and improves performance. It also catches more errors at compile-time. Advanced users can create custom effects, manage dependencies, run tasks in parallel, and write better tests. 

The library makes it easier to write and understand code that deals with many async operations at once. This is especially useful in blockchain development, where many operations happen in sequence.
